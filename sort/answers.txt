sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Using sort1 to sort sorted50000.txt took significantly lesser time than sorting reversed or random. I know this behaviour is shown by bubble sort because it has an upperbound running time of O(n^2) and lowerbound running time of Omega(n).

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Took the least amount of time to sort random50000 and reversed50000 than sort1 and sort2.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: sort3 took the same amount of time for all 3 types of arrangements. I know this is selection sort because it's running time is Theta(n^2), just like sort3.
